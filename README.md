### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Josh. I work in IT. Specifically onboarding/offboarding clients for the MSP I work for. I handle the tasks related to rolling out toolsets (RMM, AV, MDR, etc.) through automation.
Most of that automation is built around the RMM leveraging Powershell, batch scripts, etc. 

Though, I have absolutely fallen in love with Python, but I don't get the chance to use it very much at work directly (aside from the time I had to onboard a client from Itarian..). Coding with Python is quickly taking over my other hobbies though.

I've decided I want to make programming more than a hobby. 

I use PyCharm and upload all my scripts here.

I focus on making my code easy to follow and neatly commented; not only for myself, but because I would like to start contributing to larger projects and get experience working with a team.

I'm currently wokring on "Python GUI Programming with Tkinter" by Alan D. Moore. I was looking for a book on Tkinter but this one seems like so much more so far.
