### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name is Josh. I work in IT. Specifically onboarding/offboarding clients for the MSP I work for. I handle the tasks related to rolling out toolsets (RMM, AV, MDR, etc) through automation.
While most of that automation is built around the RMM leveraging Powershell, Windows batch, etc, I have absolutely fallen in love with Python, and wish I could use it more at work. It's quickly taking over my other hobbies such as Chess and music.

I've decided I want to make Python more than a hobby. Therefore, I am continually learning Python, strengthening my programming basics through reptition.

Iâ€™m currently working on any and all projects I have an idea for. Incorporating as many libraries/modules as I can. Tutorials and Udemy courses are great (Big thanks to teachers such as Tim Buchalka and Al Sweigart who make this process easier than it would be otherwise), but I learn best by working on real projects. 

I'm currently splitting most of my programming time between work projects to automate and make my life easier, and finishing the second half of Al Aweigart's Automate the Boring Stuff (after a 3 year hiatus).
While AtBS is focused on beginners and non-programmers, I have been working my practice projects with strict adherance to PEP 8 style, added bells and whistles to each project, and I try to make proper docstrings and functions. I upload all my practice projects to: https://github.com/JoshSmith84/AutomatetheBoring and my work scripts to https://github.com/JoshSmith84/Work-Stuff
I focus on making my code easy to follow and neatly commented not only for myeslf but because I would like to start contributing to larger projects and get experience working with a team.
